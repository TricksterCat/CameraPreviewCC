# Camera preview

![image](./md/preview.png)

This small extension emits GameView from Unity3d.
My personal pain has become to see the editor in which I cannot see how the first frame will look within the camera without launching the play mode.
I tried to optimize as much as I could, but I am not completely sure, the communication scene => panel via base64 image seems a little crazy to me. I hope I will find a way to solve this.

## Install

```bash
# Install dependent modules
npm install
# build
npm run build
```
## How to use:
1) In the "Panel" menu, select "Camera Preview"
2) In the panel that opens, select the desired camera, frame rate and scale.

P.S. The resolution is taken from the Design width and height from the project settings.

## Donation
This extension is completely free.
I will be glad if you find it useful and want to thank me.
