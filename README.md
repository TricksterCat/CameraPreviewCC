# Camera preview

![alt](md\preview.png)

This small extension emits GameView from Unity3d.
My personal pain has become to see the editor in which I cannot see how the first frame will look within the camera without launching the play mode.
I tried to optimize as much as I could, but I am not completely sure, the communication scene => panel via base64 image seems a little crazy to me. I hope I will find a way to solve this.

## Install

```bash
# Install dependent modules
npm install
# build
npm run build
```

## Donation
This extension is completely free.
I will be glad if you find it useful and want to thank me.
